# Cryptography : Its a a Method of protecting information and communication through the use of codes.

The development of the electric telegraph in the early 19th century allowed for near-instant communication through wires across continents. This was much faster than sending a horseback rider carrying a bag of letters. However, the telegraph couldn’t directly send written letters drawn on paper. 
Instead it could send electric pulses. A short pulse is called a “dot” and a long pulse is called a “dash”.

<br/>
In order to convert these dots and dashes to English letters of the alphabet, an encoding system (or code) is needed to translate from English to electric pulse code (called encoding) and at the other end translate electric pulses to English (called decoding). The code to do this over telegraphs (and later, radio) was called Morse Code, and was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. By tapping out dots and dashes with a one button telegraph, a telegraph operator could communicate an English message to someone on the other side of the world almost instantly!<br/>

Codes are made to be understandable and publicly available. Anyone should be able to look up what a code’s symbols mean to decode an encoded message. 
There are Ciphers that are indented to be understandable only for message sender and reciever.
Caesar cipher is easiest one to learn which is 2000 years old.
We will Learn Many ciphers and encoding methods and decoding methods with python programs.
