===============================
Project that consists of Python Programs that implements most of Cryptography Algorithms and shows Encryption and Decryption procedures and cracking few by Brute Force Attack!

## Cryptography : Its a Method of protecting information and communication through the use of codes.

The purpose of cryptography is to make difficult to understand for others on private communication messages between two people.</br>
So that your messages are protected as secret from others. No body knows what message you sent except you and the reciever.</br>

### Objective : 
1. Here You will Learn what are different ways you can protect your data and messages and how it works and why it works.</br>
1. Also we convert messages to some code and again back to the original messages.</br>
1. Then we will see how you can hack into other crypto algorithms. (Its not illegal on Crypto algorithms we crack).</br>

### Pre-Requisite : 
- [x] You Have to know Nothing but few basics of Python Programming. (To Learn Python: https://github.com/prashanthprabhu24/LearnPython (Course 2 only) )

### Short History : 
* The development of the electric telegraph in the early 19th century allowed for near-instant communication through wires across continents. 
* This was much faster than sending a horseback rider carrying a bag of letters. 
* However, the telegraph couldn’t directly send written letters drawn on paper. 
* Instead it could send electric pulses. 
* A short pulse is called a “dot” and a long pulse is called a “dash”.

<br/>

* In order to convert these dots and dashes to English letters of the alphabet, an encoding system (or code) is needed to translate from English to electric pulse code (called encoding) and at the other end translate electric pulses to English (called decoding).<br/>
* The code to do this over telegraphs (and later, radio) was called Morse Code, and was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail.<br/>
* By tapping out dots and dashes with a one button telegraph, a telegraph operator could communicate an English message to someone on the other side of the world almost instantly!<br/>
* Codes are made to be understandable and publicly available.<br/>
* Anyone should be able to look up what a code’s symbols mean to decode an encoded message.<br/>
* From Morse Code, to many advance secured Agorithms are used from different century. Today we use RSA which no one able to crack till now.
* Today we have fast computers that can do millions of computations per second which makes brute force attack on many old crypto systems vulnerable.
* Algorithms used today by by google and etc to secure web pages and bank systems are still secure even with super computers that are 1000+ times faster than regular computers.

### How to Run ? : 
* Give a pull request to this Repo and Save the complete Project into the any Python IDE project Folder.
  #### Affine Cipher : 
  ##### To Encrypt/Decrypt : 
     * Open "Affine Cipher" Folder
     * Run "affineCipher.py". 
     * It prompts a Text to type in. Type the Plain text to encrypt or Cipher text to decrypt.
     * It again prompts to enter the Key used both for encryption and Decryption. Enter any key with higher value. (2023 is i used)
     * At last Enter do you want to encrypt or decrypt. Enter "Encrypt" for encryption and "Decrypt" for decryption.
     * It does the process and displays the result and also copies to the clipboard so you can paste it in a file or mail.
